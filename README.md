# Hexokinase (update soon)
Python programs that include model, numerical solutions of ODEs, and sensitivity analysis programs, where

- the \_model_.py file is a file of the model of nonlinear ODEs,
- the \_2work_.py file is used for calculating the numerical solutions of the model in \_model_.py file for appropriate parameter values,
- and the \_new2SA_.py file is used for implementing a global sensitivity analysis of the model.
